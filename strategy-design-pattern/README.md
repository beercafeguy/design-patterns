# Strategy Design Pattern or Policy Design Pattern

As its name suggests, this pattern is used to saperate algorithm (Strategy) from API calls. Collections.sort() is java collections API is an excellent example for this pattern. There the strategy to sort the collection has been handed over to the user.

In this project, I have created 3 example use cases
* Duck design
* Shopping Cart
* Sports Players Implementation

Details of these examples are given in Wiki
